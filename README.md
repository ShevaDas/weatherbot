![WeatherBot sample](http://puu.sh/hqHpE/1b6791c520.png)

Ever wanted to know what the weather's like in San Diego on Tuesday--from the comfort of your command line? In this short<sup>1</sup>, simple<sup>2</sup> C program, WeatherBot will fetch the 5 day weather forecast for any zip code you care to provide and then use advanced natural language processing<sup>3</sup> to helpfully inform you of all the important little details you want to know, like the weather.

Created as a final project for Computing II (project requirements: "must be written in C and use a data structure").

Built using the Yahoo! Weather API and many, many helpful internet sources (cited in weatherbot.c, will be transferred over here when I get around to it).

<sup><sub>Someone please slap me if I ever try to do anything involving API requests, JSON processing, or advanced string parsing in C ever again.</sup></sub>


<sup>1</sup>Not actually short<br/>
<sup>2</sup>Not actually simple<br/>
